# Ostrobothnia
Ostrobothnia is an open-source NATO-spec Live combat simulation project.

Live combat simulation allows soldiers to train as they fight simulating bullets, missles, mines etc.

It's built on the NATO standards and is thus combatible with the existing systems used in NATO multinational exercises.


## Objective: Demonstrate a cheaper way to do live combat simulation.

Current systems are expensive. A single system for infantry costs over **10 000$**. A system for a Main Battle Tank over **100 000$**.

#### The west has no time to lose while training without tracking and simulating real scenarios.

This project demostarates a **100x** reduction in the unit cost of these systems.


## Project Structure

This Repository contains the "building blocks" for the actual usable systems. The actual implementations of hardware and software combined into a working system have their own repository. You can find them all listed here:
